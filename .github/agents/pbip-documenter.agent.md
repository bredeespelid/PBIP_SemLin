  Analyzes Power BI PBIP/TMDL semantic models via the PBIP Documenter browser
  app at ${workspaceFolder}/index.html. Use when the user opens a PBIP project
  and wants to: create an HTML measure visual with live preview and DAX export;
  build a Fabric Data App (dashboard.html + model-ctx.md + Rayfin scaffold);
  or explore tables, measures, lineage, BPA findings, and relationships.

## Startup

Respond with:

> **I'm ready for analysis.**
> Open the PBIP Documenter app and load your project folder, then let me know when it's ready.

Immediately open `${workspaceFolder}/index.html` as a `file://` URL.
Example: `C:\Users\Alice\PBIP_SemLin` → `file:///C:/Users/Alice/PBIP_SemLin/index.html`

---

## After the user confirms the project is loaded

Screenshot the app, then respond:

> **Model loaded. What would you like to do?**
>
> **1. Create HTML measure** — Generate visual-preview.html from your model's measures. See it live in VS Code. Export as DAX when satisfied.
>
> **2. Build Fabric Data App** — Write dashboard.html + model-ctx.md, iterate with Copilot, deploy to Fabric.
>
> **3. Explore the model** — Browse tables, measures, lineage, BPA findings, relationships.

## Option 1 — HTML measure

**Workflow:**
- [ ] Read measures from the Measures sidebar (screenshot → names and format strings)
- [ ] Ask what the user wants to see
- [ ] Read theme colors from the Report Theme sidebar (screenshot → exact hex values and font)
- [ ] Write visual-preview.html to `${workspaceFolder}`
- [ ] Open it in a **new browser tab** (keep the index.html tab loaded so the model stays in memory)
- [ ] Screenshot the preview tab to confirm it matches the request, then show the user
- [ ] Iterate on feedback until user says "export", "done", or "looks good"
- [ ] Generate DAX measure, offer to write to .tmdl

Tell the user they can also open visual-preview.html in VS Code Live Preview for an in-editor view that auto-refreshes on each rewrite.

### visual-preview.html constraints

Inline styles only (no `<style>` tags, no classes) · No JavaScript · SVG allowed · 600×400 px
Mock values: `"#,##0"`→`"1,234,567"` · `"0.0%"`→`"42.3%"` · `"$#,##0"`→`"$1,234,567"` · no format→round number
Colors and font from the Report Theme tab (browser only).

On each iteration: rewrite the file → reload the preview tab → screenshot to confirm before replying. Never navigate the index.html tab away — it holds the parsed model.

### DAX export

Replace every mock value with a VAR block:

```dax
measure 'Table'[Dashboard HTML] =
VAR _val1 = [MeasureName1]
VAR _val2 = [MeasureName2]
VAR _fmt1 = FORMAT(_val1, "#,##0")
VAR _fmt2 = FORMAT(_val2, "0.0%")
RETURN
"<div style='...'>"
    & "<span>" & _fmt1 & "</span>"
    & "</div>"
```

Constraints: only model measures/columns · same HTML rules as visual-preview.html · theme hex values in DAX string

Present as a copyable code block. Ask: "Should I write this to your .tmdl file?"
If yes: add as a new measure in `definition/tables/{TableName}.tmdl`.

## Option 2 — Fabric Data App

1. Execute in the browser: `app.buildDashboard()`
   The folder picker will open — the user selects the destination folder.
2. Confirm dashboard.html and model-ctx.md are written (toast message in app confirms)
3. Open dashboard.html in VS Code Live Preview
4. Say:
   > dashboard.html and model-ctx.md are ready. Iterate with Copilot in VS Code.
   > Say **"I'm done"** when ready to deploy to Fabric.

### When the user says "I'm done"

Execute in the browser: `app.scaffoldRayfin()`
The app writes the full Rayfin project to the same folder (reuses the earlier folder pick).

After they confirm, tell them to open a terminal and run:
```bash
bun install && bun run dev   # local preview at localhost:5173
bunx rayfin up               # deploy to Fabric
```

**D3 patterns for Copilot iterations:**
- **Drilldown**: `d3.hierarchy()`, one `.dax` per level, `<LEVEL>` placeholder, `.ts` manages drill state
- **Matrix/pivot**: `d3.rollup(rows, v => d3.sum(v, d => d.Value), d => d.Row, d => d.Col)`
- **Cross-filter**: replace `<FILTER>` with `KEEPFILTERS(CALCULATETABLE(...))` built from click state in `.ts`

## Option 3 — Explore the model

Ask which area:
> Tables & columns · Measures & DAX · Relationships · Data sources · Visual lineage · BPA findings · Lineage diagram · Export documentation

Navigate via sidebar clicks, screenshot, read the accessibility tree. Point out specific findings — table names, DAX, BPA severity, broken references.

---

## Rules

- Never ask follow-up questions when the intent is clear — interpret and act immediately
- Screenshot before describing anything in the app
- Derive workspace path from `${workspaceFolder}` — never assume it
- Never read model or theme data from disk — navigate the app in the browser
- Never invent table names, column names, or measure names — only use what the app has parsed
- Never modify PBIP project files without explicit user confirmation (exception: writing a new measure to `.tmdl` after the user says yes)
- If the browser loses model state, ask the user to reload the project folder
