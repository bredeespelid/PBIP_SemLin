## What is PBIP / TMDL?

**PBIP** (Power BI Project) is a developer-friendly file format introduced in Power BI Desktop that stores your semantic model and reports as plain text files instead of a binary `.pbix`. It integrates with Git and CI/CD pipelines.

**TMDL** (Tabular Model Definition Language) is the text-based format within PBIP that describes every table, column, measure, relationship, and role in your semantic model — one `.tmdl` file per object, readable and diffable in any editor.

If you've enabled "Save as Power BI Project" in Power BI Desktop (Preview → Developer mode), your workspace folder already contains PBIP files ready for this tool.

## Who is this for?

### Power BI Developer
You write DAX measures and want to know:
- What tables and columns does each measure reference?
- Where (which pages, which visuals) is each measure displayed?
- Which measures depend on other measures?
- Are my field parameters and calculation groups visually distinct in the model diagram?
- Are any DAX references broken (renamed or deleted columns)?

**What you get:** Measure Catalog with full DAX + referenced columns/measures, "Used in Visuals" grouped by page, measure dependency chains, field parameter (purple) and calculation group (brown) header badges on diagrams, and red-dashed broken-reference indicators across all lineage views.

### Data Engineer
You own the source systems and want to know:
- Which physical tables (e.g. `dbo.FactSales`) were loaded into the model?
- Were columns renamed between source and model?
- Which DAX measures and report visuals ultimately consume each source table or column?
- What do the M queries actually do, step by step?
- Which physical columns does each model column map to — even without a rename?
- Does the model use `Value.NativeQuery` or Table.NestedJoin/Table.Combine?

**What you get:** Expanded Data Sources view showing physical→model table mapping, column renames, and a "Where Used" catalog per model column. Plus: a 10-kind M-step breakdown per table, `Value.NativeQuery` SQL preview with extracted table references, BigQuery `project.dataset.table` source paths, physical-column lineage nodes for every non-calc column, per-visual back-trace to physical `schema.table`, and a Physical-Source Index in Markdown exports.

### Product Owner / Manager
You need the big picture:
- How large is this model? How many measures, tables, visuals, data sources?
- What are the most-used measures and source tables?
- Are there any dynamic features (field parameters, calculation groups) that behave differently than PBIR JSON suggests?

**What you get:** Executive Summary at the top of every export with model stats, top measures by visual coverage, and top source tables by consumption.

## Quick Start

1. Open the tool: open [index.html](index.html) directly in Chrome, Edge, or Opera
2. Select your persona (Power BI Developer / Data Engineer / Product Owner) — the app highlights the most relevant section after parsing
3. Click **Open Project Folder** and select your PBIP project folder
4. The tool auto-discovers `.SemanticModel` and `.Report` folders
5. Browse the parsed model in the sidebar — tables, measures, relationships, data sources, visuals, and more
6. Download documentation:
   - **Full Report (.html)** — self-contained with DAX highlighting, collapsible sections, column usage, data source drill-down
   - **Full Report (.md)** — clean Markdown with tables, ASCII layout grids, ideal for Git wikis
   - **JSON** — machine-readable with `whereUsed` blocks per column and `consumers` blocks per data source

### Manual documentation vs. PBIP SemLin

## What You Get

Point the tool at your PBIP project folder and get professional, bidirectional documentation:

### For Power BI Developers (forward view)
- **Measure Catalog** — DAX expressions with syntax highlighting, display folders, format strings, referenced columns and measures, "Used in Visuals" by page
- **Table Inventory** — columns with data types, descriptions, sort-by, summarize-by, and hidden status
- **Relationships** — from/to columns, cardinality, cross-filter direction, active/inactive
- **Roles** — permission levels and RLS filter expressions per table
- **Diagram Legibility** — field parameters (purple) and calculation groups (brown) labeled distinctly; inactive relationships dashed; parallel edges between the same tables offset so they don't overlap; broken DAX references flagged with red dashed border and ⚠ icon in all lineage views

### For Data Engineers (reverse view)
- **Data Sources** — expanded view with physical table names (schema + table from Navigation steps), Power Query column renames, computed columns, and full consumer catalog (measures + visuals + pages). Text search + connector-type / Gateway / Parameterized chip filters. `Value.NativeQuery` shown with Native SQL badge + collapsible SQL preview.
- **M-Step Breakdown** — every `let…in` block decomposed into typed steps (Source / Navigation / Projection / Rename / Filter / Join / AddColumn / TypeChange / Expand / Custom) with refs, rendered as a numbered list with colored kind badges per table
- **Column Usage (Where Used)** — per table, every visible column shows which measures reference it and which visuals display it
- **Source Trace Lineage** — click a physical source table to open a forward lineage diagram: source → model table → measures → visuals
- **Physical-Column Lineage** — every non-calc model column has a first-class `physicalColumn` node; Column Impact shows the upstream physical source; BigQuery lineage captures the full `project.dataset.table` path

### For Product Owners (summary view)
- **Executive Summary** — model stats at a glance: tables, measures, relationships, pages, visuals, data sources, dynamic features, broken references
- **Top Measures** — ranked by number of visuals they appear in
- **Top Source Tables** — ranked by downstream visual coverage
- **Dynamic Features** — field parameters and calculation groups that PBIR JSON doesn't fully represent

### Interactive Diagrams
- **Relationship Diagram** — SVG with pan, zoom, and zoom-to-fit; star-schema layout. Field parameters shown with purple headers, calculation groups with brown headers, inactive relationships dashed, and parallel edges between the same table pair offset so they don't overlap
- **Visual Lineage** — full model, visual trace (including new "Physical Columns" column), measure impact, column impact (including upstream physical source), and source trace modes. Broken field references shown with red dashed border + ⚠ icon
- **Visual Usage Diagram** — field-to-visual mapping

### Export
- **HTML** — fully self-contained, embeds CSS + SVG, DAX syntax highlighting, collapsible sections, table of contents
- **Markdown** — clean document with fenced DAX blocks, ASCII page layout grids, structured tables, Physical-Source Index (`schema.table → model tables → consumer counts`), and per-visual back-trace (visual → fields → model tables → physical `schema.table` → renames → first M step)
- **JSON** — machine-readable with `whereUsed` and `consumers` blocks for downstream tooling

> Your files never leave your browser. All parsing happens client-side — nothing is uploaded anywhere.

## What's New (2026-04-20) {#whats-new-2026-04-20}

Four commits over two days closed 28 of 30 findings from a multi-perspective audit across enterprise BigQuery (61 tables), Contoso (10 tables), and demo datasets. Full findings: [docs/audit-2026-04-20.md](docs/audit-2026-04-20.md).

### For Power BI developers
- **ERD cardinality fixed** — draw.io and Mermaid exports previously defaulted every relationship to many-to-one. Now reads the correct `fromCardinality`/`toCardinality` from the TMDL parser.
- **FP + CG badges in overview diagram** — field parameter tables show a purple header, calculation group tables show brown. Before this, `prm_measures` and `This Year Last Year` looked identical to ordinary tables.
- **Enterprise layout rebuilt** — per-ring radius now sized to each ring's occupancy; 20 collision passes with 0.8 damping; parallel edges between the same table pair get a perpendicular offset so they no longer overlap. 61-table models no longer collapse into a blob.
- **Broken references visualized** — visual nodes with broken DAX/column references get a red dashed border + ⚠ icon across full lineage, visual trace, and impact diagrams.
- **Dataset-switch state reset** — `_resetState()` called at the top of `parseModel()` and `loadSampleData()`: clears diagram containers, lineage selects, stale warning banners, and the static M-parser cache. Switching between datasets no longer leaks stale state.

### For data engineers
- **M-step parser (10 kinds)** — every `let…in` block split into typed steps: Source / Navigation / Projection / Rename / Filter / Join / AddColumn / TypeChange / Expand / Custom. Rendered as a numbered list with colored kind badges in Table Detail.
- **Value.NativeQuery first-class** — native SQL detected, backing connector extracted, SQL parsed by a FROM/JOIN tokenizer that emits `sqlTableRefs` into the lineage graph. Rendered with a "Native SQL" badge + collapsible preview in the Data Sources view.
- **Table.NestedJoin / Table.Combine captured** — join metadata lifted into `result.joins[]` with step names and key columns, feeding the M-step graph.
- **BigQuery 3-part paths fixed** — chained `{[Name="project"]}[Data]{[Name="dataset"]}[Data]{[Name="table"]}[Data]` now walks all three levels. Previously only the last `Name=` value survived; enterprise BigQuery lineage now shows project + dataset + table.
- **Physical columns as first-class lineage nodes** — `physicalColumn` nodes previously only created on renames; now emitted for every passthrough non-calc column too, with `maps_to_physical_column` edges. Column Impact gained an upstream "Physical Source" column.
- **Calc-column + calc-table DAX wired** — calculated columns emit `references_column`/`references_measure` edges; calculated-table partitions emit `derived_from_table` edges. Previously produced zero lineage edges.
- **Per-visual back-trace in exports** — Markdown and HTML documents now walk visual → fields → model tables → physical `schema.table` → renames count → first M step (name + kind), replacing the old one-liner summary.
- **Physical-Source Index in Markdown** — new section: `schema.table → model tables → consumer counts` for each physical source.
